# CI/CD Setup Summary for VS Code LM API Explorer

## ✅ Completed Setup

Your GitHub CI/CD pipeline is now fully configured and ready for the `main` branch workflow. Here's what has been set up:

### 🔄 Workflow Files (Updated for Main Branch)

1. **`ci.yml`** - General CI Pipeline
   - Triggers on push/PR to `dev` or `main` branches
   - Runs lint, type-check, tests, and builds

2. **`dev.yml`** - Development CI Pipeline  
   - Triggers on push/PR to `dev` branch
   - Creates development build artifacts

3. **`main-protection.yml`** - Main Branch Protection
   - Triggers on PRs to `main` branch
   - Enforces that PRs come only from `dev` branch
   - Validates version bumps before merging
   - Runs comprehensive test suite

4. **`release.yml`** - Release Pipeline
   - Triggers on push to `main` branch
   - Automatically creates GitHub releases
   - Publishes to VS Code Marketplace
   - Uses auto-generated release notes

### 📋 Required GitHub Secrets

You need to configure these secrets in your GitHub repository:

1. **`VSCE_PAT`** - VS Code Marketplace Personal Access Token
   - Go to: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers/
   - Create a personal access token with marketplace publishing permissions
   - Add as repository secret in GitHub

2. **`GITHUB_TOKEN`** - Automatically provided by GitHub Actions

### 🌿 Branch Strategy

- **`dev` branch**: All development work
- **`main` branch**: Release-only branch with automated publishing
- **Feature branches**: Created from and merged back into `dev`

### 🚀 Release Process

1. **Development**: Work in `dev` branch
2. **Version Bump**: Use the release helper script:
   ```powershell
   npm run release:prepare
   ```
3. **Create PR**: From `dev` to `main` branch
4. **Automated Release**: Upon merge to `main`:
   - Creates GitHub release with auto-generated notes
   - Publishes to VS Code Marketplace
   - Tags version automatically

### 🛡️ Branch Protection (Recommended)

Configure these branch protection rules in GitHub repository settings:

#### Main Branch Protection:
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ✅ Require a pull request before merging
- ✅ Require review from code owners (recommended)
- ✅ Restrict pushes that create files
- ✅ Do not allow bypassing the above settings
- ❌ Allow force pushes (disabled for safety)

#### Dev Branch Protection:
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ✅ Allow force pushes (for development flexibility)

### 📝 Next Steps

1. **Configure GitHub Secrets**: Add the `VSCE_PAT` secret to your repository
2. **Set up Branch Protection**: Apply the recommended protection rules
3. **Test the Workflow**: 
   - Make a change in `dev` branch
   - Use `npm run release:prepare` to bump version
   - Create PR from `dev` to `main`
   - Merge to trigger automatic release

### ✨ Features

- **Automated version validation** - Ensures versions are properly bumped
- **Quality gates** - All tests must pass before release
- **Automatic releases** - No manual intervention needed
