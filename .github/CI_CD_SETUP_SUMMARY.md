# CI/CD Setup Summary

## ✅ What's Been Configured

### 🔄 GitHub Workflows
- **`ci.yml`** - Basic CI for all branches (test, lint, build)
- **`dev.yml`** - Development-focused pipeline with artifact creation
- **`release.yml`** - Automated release to GitHub + VS Code Marketplace
- **`master-protection.yml`** - Validates PRs to master branch

### 🌿 Branch Strategy
- **`dev`** - Development branch (all work happens here)
- **`master`** - Release-only branch (triggers automated publishing)

### 🛠️ Helper Scripts
- **`scripts/prepare-release.ps1`** - Interactive version bumping (Windows)
- **`scripts/prepare-release.sh`** - Interactive version bumping (Bash)
- **`scripts/validate-workflows.ps1`** - Validates CI/CD configuration

### 📚 Documentation
- **`.github/WORKFLOW_DOCUMENTATION.md`** - Complete workflow guide
- **`.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md`** - Branch protection rules
- **Updated README.md** - Development workflow section

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### For Development
```powershell
# 1. Switch to dev branch
git checkout dev

# 2. Create feature branch (optional)
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# 3. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# 4. Push to dev
git push origin dev
```

### For Releases
```powershell
# 1. Ensure you're on dev branch
git checkout dev

# 2. Use release helper
npm run release:prepare

# 3. Push changes
git push origin dev

# 4. Create PR from dev to master
# (GitHub UI or CLI)

# 5. Merge PR - automatic release will trigger!
```

## 🔐 Required Setup

### GitHub Repository Secrets
Add in GitHub Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions:

1. **`VSCE_PAT`**
   - Go to [VS Code Marketplace Publisher Management](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage)
   - Create Personal Access Token with "Marketplace (Publish)" scope
   - Add as repository secret

### Branch Protection (Optional but Recommended)
See `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md` for detailed configuration.

## 🎯 What Happens When

### Push to `dev` branch:
- ✅ Runs tests and linting
- ✅ Creates development build
- ✅ Uploads artifact for testing

### PR to `master` branch:
- ✅ Validates source is `dev` branch
- ✅ Checks version was bumped
- ✅ Runs full test suite
- ✅ Validates build succeeds

### Push to `master` branch:
- ✅ Runs tests
- ✅ Builds extension
- ✅ Creates GitHub release
- ✅ Publishes to VS Code Marketplace
- ✅ Auto-generates release notes

## 🔧 Available Commands

### Development
```powershell
npm test                    # Run test suite
npm run lint               # Code linting  
npm run check-types        # TypeScript checking
npm run package            # Production build
npm run watch              # Development watch mode
```

### Release Management
```powershell
npm run release:prepare         # Interactive release prep (Windows)
npm run release:prepare:bash    # Interactive release prep (Bash)
npm run workflows:validate      # Validate CI/CD setup
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Release Failed
- Check `VSCE_PAT` secret is configured
- Verify version was bumped in package.json
- Ensure all tests pass

### Master Branch Rejected
- Verify PR is from `dev` branch only
- Check version has been incremented
- Ensure CI checks pass

### Marketplace Publishing Failed
- Verify publisher name matches marketplace account
- Check extension builds without errors
- Ensure all required package.json fields present

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Configure GitHub Secrets** (required for marketplace publishing)
2. **Set up Branch Protection** (recommended for safety)
3. **Test the Workflow** with a small change
4. **Create First Release** using the helper scripts

🎉 **Your CI/CD pipeline is ready!** All development in `dev`, releases via `master`.
