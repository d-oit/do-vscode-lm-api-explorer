### Example Workflows

#### 1. Manual Changeset Creation
```bash
npm run changeset:create
# Select type: feature
# Description: "Added user authentication"
# Changes: 
# - Added login/logout functionality
# - Added session management
# - Added password validation
```

#### 2. Auto-Detected Changeset Creation
```bash
npm run changeset:create
# Select type: auto
# System analyzes git commits...
# Auto-detected type: feature
# Auto-generated description: "Authentication system improvements"
# Auto-generated changes from git commits
# User confirms or modifies
```

#### 3. Auto-Detected Release
```bash
npm run changeset:release-auto
# Analyzes git commits: finds breaking changes
# Auto-detects: major version bump
# Processes changesets
# Updates to version 2.0.0
# Updates changelog
```

#### 4. CI/CD Status Check
```bash
npm run changeset:status
# Shows current version: 1.0.0
# Pending changesets: 2
# Recommended version bump: minor
# Detailed changeset information
```

#### 5. Automated CI/CD Release
```bash
npm run changeset:ci-release
# Processes changesets automatically
# Sets GitHub Actions outputs
# Updates version and changelog
# Prepares for automated release workflow
```

### GitHub Actions Integration

#### Auto-Release Workflow
- **Triggers**: Push to main (when changesets detected) or manual dispatch
- **Process**: 
  1. Detects pending changesets using `changeset:status`
  2. Processes them using `changeset:ci-release` 
  3. Creates git tags and pushes to trigger release workflow
  4. Provides comprehensive logging and error handling

#### Enhanced Release Workflow  
- **Triggers**: Git tag push (from auto-release or manual)
- **Process**:
  1. Extracts version-specific changelog content
  2. Builds and packages VS Code extension (VSIX)
  3. Creates GitHub release with changeset-generated notes
  4. Attaches VSIX file for easy distribution
  5. Provides release summary with links and metadata

## Testing Results

✅ **Auto-detection successfully tested**:
- Analyzed 10 recent commits
- Detected breaking changes from "remove" keywords
- Correctly recommended major version bump (0.3.2 → 1.0.0)
- Generated appropriate changelog entry
- Processed and cleaned up changeset files

## Integration with Existing Workflow

The system integrates seamlessly with your current setup and provides multiple automation levels:

### Manual Workflow
1. **Development**: Create changesets as you work (`npm run changeset:create`)
2. **Release Preparation**: Use auto-detection (`npm run changeset:release-auto`)
3. **Final Release**: Existing scripts handle packaging and publishing
4. **Manual Tagging**: Create and push git tags to trigger releases

### Semi-Automated Workflow
1. **Development**: Create changesets during development
2. **Status Check**: Run `npm run changeset:status` to review pending changes
3. **Manual Trigger**: Use GitHub Actions "Run workflow" to trigger release
4. **Automated Processing**: GitHub Actions handles the rest automatically

### Fully Automated Workflow
1. **Development**: Create changesets as you work
2. **Push to Main**: System automatically detects changesets on push
3. **Automated Release**: GitHub Actions processes changesets and creates releases
4. **Zero Manual Intervention**: Complete hands-off release process
