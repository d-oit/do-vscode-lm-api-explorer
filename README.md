**🐛 Troubleshooting**: AI features not working? Test model compatibility and identify issues
**📊 Comparison**: Multiple AI providers? Compare capabilities and responses side-by-side

## 🔧 GitHub Copilot Setup

To access GitHub Copilot chat models through the VS Code Language Model API, you need:

### 📋 Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Copilot Subscription**: Active GitHub Copilot Individual, Business, or Enterprise subscription
2. **GitHub Copilot Chat Extension**: Install the "GitHub Copilot Chat" extension from the VS Code marketplace
3. **Authentication**: Sign in to your GitHub account in VS Code

### 🔧 Setup Steps

1. Install the GitHub Copilot Chat extension:
   - Open VS Code Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
   - Search for "GitHub Copilot Chat"
   - Install the official extension by GitHub

2. Sign in to GitHub:
   - Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
   - Run `GitHub Copilot: Sign In`
   - Follow the authentication flow

3. **Grant Language Model Access**:
   - The first time you run the extension's command (`AI Model Explorer: Discover & Test Available Models`), VS Code will prompt you to grant permission for this extension to access language models provided by GitHub Copilot Chat. **You must click "Allow"** for the extension to function correctly.
   - This prompt typically looks like: "The extension 'd.o. vscode-lm Explorer' wants to access the language models provided by GitHub Copilot Chat."

4. Verify access:
   - Run this extension's command `AI Model Explorer: Discover & Test Available Models` again.
   - You should now see GitHub Copilot models listed (e.g., `copilot-gpt-4o`).

### 🔍 Troubleshooting

- **No models showing**: Ensure you're signed in to GitHub and have an active Copilot subscription
- **Authentication issues**: Try `GitHub Copilot: Sign Out` then sign in again
- **Extension conflicts**: Disable other AI extensions temporarily to test
