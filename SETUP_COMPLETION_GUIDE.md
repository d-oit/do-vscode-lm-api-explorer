- ✅ `dev.yml` - Development CI with artifact creation
- ✅ `main-protection.yml` - Main branch protection validation
- ✅ `release.yml` - Automated release to GitHub & VS Code Marketplace

### 📚 Documentation Created
- ✅ `.github/WORKFLOW_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Complete workflow guide
- ✅ `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md` - Branch protection configuration
- ✅ `.github/CI_CD_SETUP_SUMMARY.md` - Quick reference guide
- ✅ Release preparation scripts (PowerShell & Bash)

## 🔧 Manual Steps Required on GitHub

### 1. Change Default Branch to Main
1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/d-oit/do-vscode-lm-api-explorer
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. In the left sidebar, click **General**
4. Scroll down to **Default branch** section
5. Click the switch icon next to `master`
6. Select `main` from the dropdown
7. Click **Update**
8. Confirm the change

### 2. Delete Master Branch (After Step 1)
After changing the default branch, you can delete the old master branch:
```bash
git push origin --delete master
```

### 3. Configure Required Secrets
Add the following secret in GitHub repository settings:

#### VSCE_PAT (Required for VS Code Marketplace publishing)
1. Go to [Visual Studio Marketplace Publisher Management](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage)
2. Create a Personal Access Token with `Marketplace (Publish)` scope
3. Add it as repository secret named `VSCE_PAT`

### 4. Set Up Branch Protection Rules
Apply the branch protection rules documented in `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md`:

#### Main Branch Protection:
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ✅ Require pull request before merging
- ✅ Require review from code owners (optional)
- ✅ Restrict pushes that create files
- ❌ Allow force pushes (disabled for safety)

#### Dev Branch Protection:
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ❌ Require pull request before merging (optional for development)
- ✅ Allow force pushes (for development flexibility)

## 🎯 Workflow Overview

### Development Workflow
1. **Work in `dev` branch** - All development happens here
2. **Feature branches** - Create from `dev`, merge back to `dev`
3. **Version bump** - Use `npm run release:prepare` when ready for release
4. **Create PR** - From `dev` to `main`
5. **Automated release** - Triggers on merge to `main`

### Release Process
```bash
# 1. Prepare release (on dev branch)
npm run release:prepare

# 2. Create PR to main branch
# (Use GitHub web interface)

# 3. Merge PR (triggers automatic release)
# - Creates GitHub release with auto-generated notes
# - Publishes to VS Code Marketplace
# - Creates git tag automatically
```

## 🔍 Validation

### Check Workflow Status
Run the validation script to verify configuration:
```bash
npm run workflows:validate
```

### Test CI/CD Pipeline
1. Make a small change in `dev` branch
2. Push to trigger dev workflow
3. Create PR to `main` to test protection workflow
4. Merge PR to test release workflow

## 🎉 Next Steps

After completing the manual GitHub steps:
1. Your CI/CD pipeline will be fully operational
2. Development workflow: `dev` → PR → `main` → automatic release
3. All releases will be automatically published to both GitHub and VS Code Marketplace
4. Branch protection ensures code quality and proper workflow
